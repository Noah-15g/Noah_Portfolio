# [Steel Strength Regression and Feature Importance](https://github.com/Noah-15g/Noah_Portfolio/blob/44e07f31ec2006bbf57a039a8002aa829f15d4e0/Steel_Strength_Regression%20(1).ipynb)
* Created Random Forest Regression model to use for extracting feature importance 
* Created Individual Conditional Expectation plots and Partial Dependence Plots 
* Shapley Value plots
 
# Concrete Crack Recognition, Neural Network
* dataset of 20,000 cracked/not cracked jpg images, even class split.
* Created Convolutional Neural Network, random forest classifier, k nearest neighbors models.
* Neural Network Interpretation 

# [Separate Circles](https://github.com/Noah-15g/Noah_Portfolio/blob/e8e6d42402d052dbea9a5375d03dfac2e9ea723f/Separate_Circles.ipynb)
* Created Support Vector Classifier model, utilizing Radial Basis Function Kernel Machine.
* Used Bayesian Optimization to optimize hyperparameters
